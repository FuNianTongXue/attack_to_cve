# Methodology for Mapping MITRE ATT&CK Techniques to CVE 
The number of vulnerabilities being reported is overwhelming.  Defenders need help processing vulnerability reports.  Standardizing the data in vulnerability reports makes it easier for defenders to interpret the report quickly and accurately.  It also enables automation since computers have an even harder time understanding the variations in terminology than humans.  This document provides a model that can be used to help standardize the way vulnerabilities are reported by using MITRE ATT&CK.
##	What is ATT&CK? 
MITRE ATT&CK provides a method for standardizing the language around vulnerabilities.  The ATT&CK framework is a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.  ATT&CK techniques provide a standard way of describing the methods adversaries use to exploit a vulnerability and what adversaries hope to achieve by exploiting the vulnerability.  In addition, the ATT&CK framework is used as a foundation for the development of threat models and methodologies by many defenders.  Using ATT&CK techniques to describe a vulnerability makes it easier for defenders integrating vulnerabilities into their threat modeling.
##	Usage
### Groupings
-	**Vulnerability Type** – Common vulnerability types (e.g., cross-site scripting and SQL injection) with common technique mappings are covered in this section.  For vulnerability types that don’t have common technique mappings, the other sections are used.
-	**Functionality** - This section groups common mappings based on the type of functionality the attacker gains access to by exploiting the vulnerability.
-	**Exploit Techniques** – This section groups common mappings depending on the method used to exploit the vulnerability.

### Mapping Categories
-	**Primary Impact** - the initial benefit gained through exploitation of a vulnerability
-	**Secondary Impact** - what the adversary can do by gaining the benefit of the primary impact (e.g., a directory traversal may have a primary impact of reading arbitrary files, which the adversary may use to read the credentials in /etc/password)
-	**Exploitation Technique** - the method used to exploit the vulnerability (e.g., a crafted file or malicious link).

### Mapping
The groupings may contain mappings for one, two, or all three categories.  It all depends on how likely different vulnerabilities in the group share that technique.  For example, vulnerabilities that modify memory (e.g., buffer overflows) share a common primary impact, but the secondary impacts and exploitation techniques are so varied that the model does not include a mapping for those categories.  Also, some groupings will have more than one technique listed for a mapping category because there are some common variations within that grouping.  In these cases, only the techniques that apply to the vulnerability should be selected.  For example, the cross-site scripting (XSS) group includes an option of [T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) (Drive-by Compromise) or [T1204.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204/001) (User Execution: Malicious Link) depending on whether the attacked is stored or not.

##	Limitations
The model is not meant to be a 100% and cannot cover all the various way systems are exploited. It is meant as an easy-to-use starting point for vulnerability reporters to standardize the way they describe some vulnerability data.
#	Vulnerability type mappings
The vulnerability type section contains mappings for many of the common vulnerability types.  Mappings for vulnerability types are only included if that type has a common set of techniques used to exploit the vulnerability or that can be executed when the vulnerability is exploited. Each vulnerability type will include a one or more of the following where applicable, a primary and secondary impact and one or more exploitation techniques.

# Examples

## CVE-2020-6960

[CVE-2020-6960](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-6960) is a SQL injection vulnerability.  The SQL injection listing the Vulnerability Type section contains mappings for the Primary Impact and Secondary Impact.  For the Primary Impact, the mapping is [T1059](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) (Command and Scripting Interpreter).  For the Secondary Impact, there are several options to choose from.  Unfortunately, the CVE record does not provide enough information to choose a Secondary Impact.

## CVE-2018-17900

[CVE-2018-17900](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-17900) is about insecure credential handling.  The in "General Credential Management Errors" grouping applies for this vulnerability.  In this case, both mappings in the model apply.  The Primary Impact is [T1552](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552) (Unsecure Credentials), when then leads to the Secondary Impact allowing the adversary to use [T1078](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078) (Valid Accounts).

## CVE-2020-11036

[CVE-2020-11036](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-11036) is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  For XSS vulnerabilities, there are standard Primary Impact and Secondary Impact mappings (T1059.007 and T1185 repectively).  However, the Exploitation Technique depends on what type of XSS vulnerability it is.  Since CVE-2020-11036 is a stored XSS vulnerability, the mapping should be [T1189](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) (Drive-by Compromise), as the attack is stored in the web page and the victims are attacked by visiting the infected web page.

## CVE-2020-5210

[CVE-2020-5210](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5210) is a buffer overflow.  Since buffer overflows modify the memory, the "Memory Modification (Memory Buffer Errors, Pointer Issues, Type Errors, etc.)" grouping is used, making the Primary Impacts [T1574](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574) (Hijack Execution Flow) and [T1499.004](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1499/004) (Endpoint Denial of Service: Application or System Exploitation).  The vulnerability also has an exploitation technique mapping of [T1548.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/001) (Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism: Setuid and Setgid).  The model does not list T1548.001 as an exploitation technique becasue it is relatively rare.
